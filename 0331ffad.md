# X1 Carbon: satisfactory performance, not for heavy use

[[X1C7]]'s performance is reasonably good for both home-office and coffee-shop use. 

The carbon does suffer a bit with heavy workloads, such as some long compilation (eg: GHCJS) tasks or IDE heavylifting (haskell-language-server). However, I can offload them to my P71 workstation at home (via manual ssh, [vscode remote ssh][vsr] or [distributed](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Distributed_build) build), and then use its binary cache ([see here](https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1308808239677571072)). 

Per the pareto principle, the carbon is still a delight to use, although one must be aware of this compromise in performance, and not to mention memory (16G max RAM).

# Installing NixOS on OVH dedicated servers

I recently setup a [AMD Ryzen 7 3700 PRO](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/infra/infra-limited-edition-2/) dedicated server at OVHcloud with NixOS. I used the `NIXOS_LUSTRATE` method of installing from an existing Linux install. This is just a brief overview of what I did for posterity:

1. Install *Debian 9* from OVH control panel
1. Follow the `NIXOS_LUSTRATE` specific instructions at [2.5.4. Installing from another Linux distribution](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/#sec-installing-from-other-distro)
1. Before the `nixos-generate-config` step, you must do the following:
   1. Fix boot partitions: YMMV, but I had to nuke `/boot` and remount `/boot/efi` back at `/boot`
   1. Static IP network configuration: I had to configure these:[^cfg]:
      - My OVH server has a static IP and does not use DHCP
        - Gateway address and name servers
      - As `networking.usePredictableInterfaceNames` is enabled by default on NixOS, the kernel will assign a [predictable](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/) interface name to the local network interface (eg: `enp1s0f0` instead of `eth0`); so use that in the static networking config.
1. Once `configuration.nix` is generated, edit it and add your ssh key to the root user.
1. Continue with the lustrate instructions as documented.

Reboot, and enjoy your fresh serving of remote NixOS.

## Alternative methods

- `clever` on IRC recommends [kexec](https://github.com/cleverca22/nix-tests/tree/master/kexec) which obviates the step 1 above, allowing you to do a *fresh* install of NixOS from the rescue boot session.
- [nixos-install-scripts](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-install-scripts/blob/master/hosters/ovh-dedicated/ovh-dedicated-wipe-and-install-nixos.sh)
      
[^cfg]: For the record, my configuration looks like this:
    ```nix
    # /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
    networking.useDHCP = false;
    networking.defaultGateway = "51.123.22.213";
    networking.nameservers = [ "8.8.8.8" ];
    networking.interfaces."enp1s0f0".ipv4.addresses = [
        {
        address = "51.133.22.209";
        prefixLength = 24;
        }
    ];
    ```

# A break from bloated software

[[18084e45]], however it also is *bloated*, causing my [[X1C7]] to act slow and sluggish. Also, I believe that - psychologically, the use (or not) of tiling manager has an effect on memory and focus. In order to find out the veracity of these impressions, I decided to go back to the [[i3]] Window manager as well as other software on the simple side of the spectrum (such as [[6e549a6d]][^vim] instead of VSCode). 

I'll document this mini project as a series of posts, beginning with this one.

[^vim]: I wanted to switch instead to Vim (inasmuch as Vim is lighter on resources), however I'd rather learn and use [Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/) than Vim scripting for extending the editor.

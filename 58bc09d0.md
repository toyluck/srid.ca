Per [One Haskell IDE to rule them all](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/01/one-haskell-ide-to-rule-them-all.html), IDE efforts in haskell are being combined in [haskell-language-server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server). 

If you want to use this today, start with [[Creating a new Haskell project with IDE support using Nix]].

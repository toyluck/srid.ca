# Developing on a dedicated server

:::{.ui .message}
As of Aug 25, I don't develop on a dedicated server anymore. Long-term I believe, from an economic point of view, that it is best to invest in a performant machine, than renting one.
:::

At the end of May 2020, I began renting a dedicated server ([Ryzen 7 3700 PRO](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/infra/infra-limited-edition-2/)) for hosting [Cerveau](https://neuron.zettel.page/041726b3.html). A month later I decided to also use it as my *primary development* machine.

## Benefits

I find developing on a dedicated machine to be beneficial in many ways:

* **Portable lifestyle**: Full access to powerful development environment regardless of where I'm. I could be in a coffee shop with a lightweight 2-in-1 computer.

* **Portable performance**: For lifestyle reasons, I am stuck with the maximum power laptops could offer. Even my "mobile workstation" Thinkpad P71 cannot match the CPU performance of the dedicated server, which compiles GHCJS Haskell projects way faster.

* **Upgrade often**: In a year, if I wish I could upgrade my dedicated server to a better performance-to-price ratio. As I use [[nixos]], migrating to a new server is simply a matter of using [the declarative config](https://github.com/srid/nix-config) and running `nixos-rebuild switch`[^install].

## Revival of the thin client

My next portable computer will likely be a Chromebook with retina-quality display and Thunderbolt support (for connecting to the 5k display). At the moment, however, I'm content with using the too-powerful P71 as a "thin client" to the dedicated server (when at home office), or taking the aging Macbook Pro 2014 to cafes and parks.

## Downsides

- Requires reliable internet connection all the time.
- GHCJS apps (`ob run`) are somewhat slower to load, however the jsaddle bridge has worked quite reliably so far in my experience.

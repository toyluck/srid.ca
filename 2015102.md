## Preliminaries

The most important shortcut to know is [SPC :][kbd], which allows you to run any
[emacs command](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractiveFunction). If you want to find out which function a particular shortcut invokes, use [SPC h k][kbd] followed by that shortcut. For the obverse---to find out the shortcut (and documentaion) for a particular function---use [SPC h f][kbd].

## Files & Buffers

Open a file:

- [SPC f f][kbd] - Open a file
- [SPC f r][kbd] - Open a recently visited file

Manage buffers:

- [SPC b b][kbd] - Switch between open buffers
- [SPC b s][kbd] - Save the active buffer
- [SPC b k][kbd] - Kill (i.e., close) the active buffer
- [SPC b l][kbd] - Switch to the last buffer

## Search

- [SPC s p][kbd] - Search across all files in the project
- [SPC s s][kbd] - Search the active buffer

## Layout

### Window management

- [SPC w s][kbd] - Split window (horizontally)
- [SPC w v][kbd] - Split window vertically
- [SPC w d][kbd] - Delete the active window
- [SPC w w][kbd] / [SPC w W][kbd] - Move cursor to the next / previous window
- [CTRL+w m m][kbd] - Maximize / restore the current buffer

### Workspace management

Think of emacs workspaces as "virtual desktops".

- [SPC TAB TAB][kbd] - Display the workspace tabbar 
- [SPC TAB n][kbd] - Create a new workspace
- [SPC TAB 1][kbd] - Go to workspace #1
- [SPC TAB 2][kbd] - Go to workspace #2 (and etc...)
- [SPC TAB \`][kbd] - Switch to the last workspace

#### Project

- [SPC p f][kbd] or [SPC SPC][kbd] - Open a file in the project
- [SPC o P][kbd] - Open a file in the project, using the project sidebar
- [SPC o p][kbd] - Show / Hide the project sidebar

## Git

doom-emacs uses [magit](https://magit.vc/). [SPC g g][kbd] brings the magit-status buffer. The following shortcuts work on this buffer:

- [s][kbd] - Stage the selected file(s) or hunk
- [u][kbd] - Unstage the selected file(s) or hunk
- [TAB][kbd] - View/Hide the diff of a selected file
- [c c][kbd] - Commit the staged changes
- [p p][kbd] - Push commits to remote repository
- [d r][kbd] - Diff range (eg: to view changes in current branch)

## Code navigation

See also: [tools/lookup](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/tools/lookup)

- [g;][kbd] - Go to last change
- [SPC s i][kbd] - Go to a symbol (eg: function) in current buffer
- [SPC c D][kbd] (or [gD][kbd]) - See a list of references for the symbol at point from throughout your project

## Editing

### Visual mode

After having selected some text:

- [S\*][kbd] - Surround selection with '`*`'

[kbd]: kbd:

# WIP: X1 Carbon Gen 7 review

:::{.ui .message}
This is [**work in progress**]{.ui .red .text} note. Ultimately it will be split into individual notes, and published under a larger note, in [[x1c7]].
:::

I recently purchased a Thinkpad X1 Carbon (Gen 7, with 10th gen processor)[^tw1] and installed [[nixos]] on it.

## Setting up Linux

[[f208fd4e]]

## What works

- Hi-res display
  - 4k resolution
  - 5k resolution via thunderbolt
  	- requires 5.9 kernel (`linuxPackages_testing` on NixOS), or [this patch][edd]
    - Netflix videos can be choppy; `mpv` works well though.
  - GNOME selects 200% scaling for both
- Audio
- Microphone (and Yeti microphone)
- Fingerprint reader
  - Works in both login screen & command-line sudo
- Suspend
- Web camera
- Trackpad
  - Nearly as good as that of a Macbook

## Stability issues

[[z:zettels?tag=x1c7/issues]]

## Software issues

I enjoy using GNOME (see [[18084e45]]), but these issues prevent it from being perfect:

- Trackpad gestures, such as two-finger swipe to go back, do not work on web browsers, with the exception of GNOME Web (which has [buggy][gnome-web-bug] hardware acceleration)
- **Google Chrome** is slow and laggy. **Chromium** works fine, though.
- [**Redshift**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Redshift) will not work on Wayland; and GNOME's night light is [broken](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/issues/39) on 5k tiled display.

## Performance

## Battery Life

Never measured. But looks to be around 6 hours (more than enough for me). I used the default [nixos-hardware] configuration; and reddit has [some tips][bat-red]. A fellow programmer reported [5 hours][bat-5h].

## Next computer

My next computer, if I choose to buy one in ~3 years, will be similar to the X1C7 but with a bit more performance (assuming battery life does not suffer); i.e., if I were to make this decision again, I'd consider Thinkpad X1E or P1 - but with integrated graphics (nvidia has poor support on Linux).
